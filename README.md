This backend will be running on port 5000

Different routes and Models are defined for interacting with the database, and perform necessary updations/selections.

SQL dump file for the MySQL database is provided in this repository structure. Username for the database is 'root' and password is blank.

Let me know if you have any further query, and I will try to help you out there.

thanks!
